## pre-10/21/2019
Drafted the skeleton of the portfolio website via assignments 1 and 2.

## 10/21/2019
Completed draft via assignment 2 and changed the formatting of the existing modules. Forced the footer to remain at the bottom of the page always, but am having difficulty affixing the header. I can get the header itself to remain at the top of the page, but the other sections bleed into that space instead of remaining in their relative positions. I don't think this is an ideal fix, but I intend to add a dummy section in the html code to create a margin betweeen the top of the visible page the first section that is scrollable.

I also need to add some more meaningful content when it comes to my bio, links to projects, and the pictures meaningful to me.
