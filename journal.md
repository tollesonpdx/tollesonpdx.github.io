# CS565 - Project 1 Individual Portfolio - Work Journal

## pre-10/21/2019
Drafted the skeleton of the portfolio website via assignments 1 and 2.

## 10/21/2019
-Completed draft via assignment 2 and changed the formatting of the existing modules. Forced the footer to remain at the bottom of the page always, but am having difficulty affixing the header. I can get the header itself to remain at the top of the page, but the other sections bleed into that space instead of remaining in their relative positions. I don't think this is an ideal fix, but I intend to add a dummy section in the html code to create a margin betweeen the top of the visible page the first section that is scrollable.
-I also need to add some more meaningful content when it comes to my bio, links to projects, and the pictures meaningful to me. 

## 10/30/2019
-Updated the draft files to include the changes made for assignment 2, exercise 3.
-Created the github.io page and debugged issues with the github version of my page not updating with changes made to the website.
-I added some bootstrap elements into my webpage, so far I've only used the navbar example found in slide deck 8.
-Spent over two hours getting a working navbar. I finally referenced this website to as a comprehensive guide. https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_navbar.asp

## 10/31/2019
-Attempted to transfer my completed navbar code into a seperate file which can then get used by every page in my site. By using this approach, I hope to be able to make changes in one place, for example "standard_navbar.html" that will automatically get used in all pages with the navbar. After a little investigation, this appears to be a more time intensive upgrade than anticipated, using jQuery or other scripts to modify the html on the fly. As such, I decided to move this task onto a newly formed "stretch goal" list.
-Split the sections into separate pages, removed extra code to facilitate customization.
-Moved the news and equine pages from the navbar to simple links within the "about" page.
-Added a YouTube video background to the main landing page. Referenced these websites for inspiration and implementation:

-Added buttons on the left hand side of the landing page.
-Updated the contact us page from the exact format submitted for class to a version that more slightly fits into the overall style of the current page. I intend to deactivate this page after grading since a user could not actually make contact.

# To Do Before Submission
Update the header and footer for every page.

# Stretch Goals / ToDo After Project Due Date
-move navbar code into a separate file for easier propogation across pages
-add credits for the videos used on the landing page
