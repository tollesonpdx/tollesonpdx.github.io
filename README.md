The purposes of this website is to display my project portfolio.
For this website I used the following resources:

- HTML
- CSS
- [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/)
- With links to 3rd party websites [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com) and [GitHub](www.github.com).

Added a YouTube video background to the main landing page. Referenced these websites for inspiration and implementation:
